Mapping /Finnegans Wake /scholarship: “the elucidation of complications” (/FW/ 109.05)

This report details progress being made on a project titled ‘Mapping /Finnegans Wake/ scholarship: Creating an online research platform linking the full text of /Finnegans Wake/ text to existing analysis.' The project began in 2018 and involves academics based at Nanyang Technological University, Columbia University, and the Centre for Manuscript Genetics, University of Antwerp. Funding for the project is being provided by the Singapore Ministry of Education's Tier 1 Academic Research Fund. The aim of the project is to link scholarship on James Joyce's /Finnegans Wake/ (1939) from the digital library JSTOR to a digital text of the book. Joyce (1882-1941) is a hugely important writer with a massive scholarly industry dedicated to his works. /Finnegans Wake/ is his final text and is a central text of literary Modernism. However, due to the difficulties and complexity of the text (it is an extremely rich text containing lexical elements from roughly seventy different languages, numerous complicated plots and ‘nodal structures', and extensive use of allusion and multilingual wordplay) it remains a great challenge for the reader and is often described as “unreadable.” [fn:1]

As writers such as Jacques Derrida and Steven Connor have suggested, /Finnegans Wake/ is something like a premonition of the internet or the information age, in that it stores so much interrelated information and that it behaves like a hypertext. Furthermore, its ‘nodal systems' invite readings that connect disparate points within the text while its references and allusions are similar to the way data is connected online. [fn:2] Computers and the internet -- especially annotation sites like fweet.org  -- have changed the way we read /Finnegans Wake/. We are less likely to experience the text in a fully linear and ‘physical' way these days -- at least in academia -- and more likely to seek out complex textual systems and patterns through the use of information technology. Despite the affinities between /Finnegans Wake/ and information technology, there is currently no website linking the text of /Finnegans Wake/ to scholarly articles about its various sections. In other words, there is nothing digitally linking the primary text to the secondary texts. At the moment, there are only non-university aligned websites providing elucidations/annotations to the text (such as fweet.org). Furthermore, there is currently no ‘map' to tell us which sections of the text have been researched and which sections remain critical ‘blind spots.' Our digital platform will contain a digital ‘map' detailing which sections of the text of /Finnegans Wake/ have received high levels of attention/scholarship and which have remained relatively unexamined.

The completed platform will include an online text of /Finnegans Wake/ (in public domain since 2013) with hyperlinks to secondary material in JSTOR, initially on work available in the flagship Joyce studies journal /James Joyce Quarterly/. Users studying a specific section of /Finnegans Wake/ will be able to see at-a-glance if any scholarship on that section is available. If the user has access to JSTOR (through their university for example), they will be able to access the material via hyperlink. As such, the proposed research platform will be of interest and use to the Joyce studies/Irish studies/Modernism studies communities both academic and non-academic. The research platform will be especially useful for scholars working on words/sentences/sections of /Finnegans Wake/ as they will be able to instantly ascertain what work has already been carried out. Our research platform might also encourage non-academics to read and work with the text.

After an preliminary presentation at the ‘Finnegans Wake at 80' conference held at Trinity College Dublin in April 2019, the project sourced a digital text of /Finnegans Wake/ (courtesy of Dr Wim Van Mierlo, University of Loughborough). In January 2020 the project received a large customized dataset from JSTOR via their ‘Data for Research' program. The dataset consisted of all the journal articles on Joyce's /Finnegans Wake/. Following work by Jonathan Reeve, we have found that there are three main /Finnegans Wake/ critical hotspots (i.e. three areas in the novel most frequented quoted in the academic literature): these are the very ‘beginning' of the text, the very ‘end' of the text, and this very long sentence from about 28% of the way through the book:

This section of /Finnegans Wake/ shows the artist figure Shem at work (Shem is based on Joyce himself). Shem's method of composition -- the accumulation of random, everyday bric-a-brac -- is also a self-reflexive commentary on Joyce' method of composing /Finnegans Wake/. Along with a structure based on Giambattista Vico's /The New Science/ (1725) and the use of multiple languages and wordplay, the gathering and adapting arrangement of pre-existing or ‘found' literary, cultural, or historical materials (including squashed quotations or “quashed quotatoes”) was a central artistic technique in Joyce's creation of the text (perhaps reflecting the confusing mergings and transformations of dreams). As such, it is easy to see why this section has become a critical hotspot -- it can be used to discuss or explain the Modernist bricolage of /Finnegans Wake/ itself. Meanwhile, the ‘beginning' and ‘ending' of the text have frequently been used to demonstrate the cyclical nature of the text -- that it has no real ‘beginning' or ‘ending'. As is well known, /Finnegans Wake/ ‘begins' (or begins again, depending) in the middle of a sentence “riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs” (/FW/ 3.1--3). The ‘beginning' of that sentence can be found at the ‘end' of the book: “Finn, again! Take. Bussoftlhee, mememormee! Till thousendsthee. Lps. The keys to. Given! A way a lone a last a loved a long the” (/FW/ 628.14--16) Thus the text's structure replicates a central theme of the text itself -- repetitions and returns (demonstrated in its preoccupations with cycles of history, literary recycling, and different forms of resurrection).

Notes

[fn:1] See page vii of Seamus Deane's introduction to the Penguin edition of /Finnegans Wake/ (London, 1992), for example.

[fn:2] “The /Wake/ seems to model itself, not on the newspaper, as /Ulysses/ seemed to do, but on the culture of electronic communications which was inaugurated in 1876 with the near-simultaneous invention of the telephone and the phonograph and accelerated in the early decades of the twentieth century with the rapid development of radio, cinema, and, from the mid-1920s, television ... /Finnegans Wake/ may be said to predict and exemplify the age of electronic media. Electronic media are the fulfilment of the scientific promise of universal convertibility of forces ... It is perhaps not surprising then that the increasing interest in applying contemporary computer technology to the study and reading of Joyce should begin to disclose a profound affinity between such technologies and their object. If /Ulysses/ and /Finnegans Wake/ call for the resources of hypertext and multimedia databases to make visible and available the wealth of interconnections of which each consists, then this is perhaps partly because the works themselves appear singly or collectively to be what Derrida, again spurred into Wakean imitation, has called a ‘programotelephonic encyclopaedia' (Connor, Steven and Creasy, Matthew. /James Joyce/ second edition. Tavistock:

       Liverpool University Press. 2012, 89--96). See also: “this 1000th generation computer -- /Ulysses/, /Finnegans Wake/ -- besides which the current technology of our computers and our micro-computerified archives and our translating machines remains a bricolage of a prehistoric child's toys. And above all its mechanisms are of a slowness incommensurable with the quasi-infinite speed of the movements on Joyce's cables. How could you calculate the speed with which a mark, a marked piece of information, is placed in contact with another in the same word or from one end of the book to another?” Derrida also discusses ‘the double or the simulation of the event ‘‘Joyce'', the name of Joyce, the signed work, the Joyce software today, joyceware' (Jacques Derrida, ‘Ulysses Gramophone: Hear Say Yes in Joyce', trans. Tina Kendall and Shari Benstock, in Jacques Derrida, ed. Derek Attridge, /Acts of Literature/. London: Routledge, 1992, 147--148).
